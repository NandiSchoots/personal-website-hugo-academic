I'm eager to find research questions that cut to the core of human understanding and hope to one day find natural laws that make highly specific predictions and apply in many contexts.

My object-level interests are all over the place and include:

* The Science of Deep Learning or finding some way to formally study neural networks that are used in practice
* Understanding Inductive Biases of Neural Networks
* Emergent Communication
* Using insight into human Theory of Mind, decision-making, reasoning, learning and language understanding to inform the design and build of AI’s with similar skills. 

I was one of the main organizers of the first [AI Safety Camp](https://aisafety.camp/) and this fall I'm hosting a retreat on Inductive Biases in Neural Networks.
