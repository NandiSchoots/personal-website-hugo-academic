I am a PhD student in the Safe and Trusted AI research group at King's and Imperial College London. I'm eager to find research questions that cut to the core of human understanding and hope to one day find natural laws that make highly specific predictions and apply in many contexts. 

My interests are all over the place and include:

* The Science of Deep Learning 
* Inductive Biases of Neural Networks
* Emergent Communication
* Using insight into human Theory of Mind, decision-making, reasoning, learning and language understanding to inform the design and build of AI’s with similar skills. 

I was one of the main organizers of the first [AI Safety Camp](https://aisafety.camp/).
